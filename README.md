

Had to install below for windows:

1. Github for windows via powershell
  - install ssh for windows via powershell
  - setup ssh keys (one for lipi's github account, one for shantanu's wnc account)
  - add public keys to respective github accounts.
  - setup local github config credentials in repective github repo folder created (D://Lipi/wnc-mess-terraform was configured)
    - git config user.name "Lipi Lapsiwala"
    - git config user.email "lipi.lapsiwala@gmail.com"
    - if this needs to be configured globally, --global flat would be used in the command above. 
    - But that will work only with one github account
  - connected local folder wnc-mess-terraform to remote repo wnc-mess-terraform
    - have to copy the config file from windows to wsl .ssh folder. 
    - set remote origin using ssh link not http link `git remote add origin git@github.com-lipi:lipi-lapsiwala/wnc-mess-terraform.git` # here github.com-lipi is the host name in configuration file for the ssh key associated with the corresponding github account.
    - verify connection to the correct github account `ssh -T git@github.com-wnc`
    - might have to create a main branch if it does not exist in local and if remote is using it. 
    - `git push --set-upstream origin main`
    - `git pull`
    - push the changes
2. Latest VSCode version was installed from microsoft store.
3. Install wsl via microsoft store
4. Install Install the WSL 2 kernel update manually
  - Go to this official link: 👉 https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel
  - It will redirect you to the Microsoft download page.
  - Download the .msi file named WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines.
  - Run the installer — it takes just 30 seconds.
5. Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS was installed from microsoft store
6. Ubuntu 24.04.1 was set as a default terminal in VS Code.
7. tfenv was installed in ubuntu.
  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install unzip
  - git clone https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv.git ~/.tfenv
  - echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.tfenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  - source ~/.bashrc
  - tfenv --version
  - tfenv install 1.6.6 (1.6.6 is the last stable version with all features. 1.7 to 10 are used by hashicorp. 1.11.3 is too latest and might not support all features)
  - tfenv use 1.6.6
  - terraform --version
8. Install Azure CLI in ubuntu
  - curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
  - az version
  - login to az: `az login --use-device-code`
    - open `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin` in browser
    - enter code shown as an output of `az login` command.
    - select an azure account to login to.
    - go back to ubuntu terminal
    - select appropriate subscription.
9. Created a free account on Terraform cloud for backend. 
  - created an organization: wnc-mess-terraform-backend
  - created a project: wnc-mess (Not useful in terraform configuration. This is for user's understanding)
  - Created a workspace: wnc-mess-terraform-backend
  - Used this URL as a reference to add environment variables in Terraform cloud workspace: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/azure-remote
  - Was giving some path error after using cloud as a backend for azure. Replaced cloud with a proper terraform {backend {} }. block.
  - updated terraform version to ~> 1.6.0 under workspace settings -> General -> Terraform version. It was 1.11.3 before. 
10. Copy over ssh keys created in step 1 from windows to linux. 
  - change permissions on ssh public and private key files in windows via powershell.
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi /inheritance:r`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi /grant:r "shant:F"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi /remove "Users" "Authenticated Users" "Everyone"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi.pub /inheritance:r`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi.pub /grant:r "shant:F"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi.pub /remove "Users" "Authenticated Users" "Everyone"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc /inheritance:r`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc /grant:r "shant:F"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc /remove "Users" "Authenticated Users" "Everyone"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc.pub /inheritance:r`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc.pub /grant:r "shant:F"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc.pub /remove "Users" "Authenticated Users" "Everyone"`
    - check grants syntax: 
      - `icacls <public or private key file path>`
      - example: `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi`
  - copy those files over to wsl
    - `cp /mnt/c/Users/shant/.ssh/id_ed25519_lipi ~/.ssh/`
    - `cp /mnt/c/Users/shant/.ssh/id_ed25519_lipi.pub ~/.ssh/`
    - `cp /mnt/c/Users/shant/.ssh/id_ed25519_wnc ~/.ssh/`
    - `cp /mnt/c/Users/shant/.ssh/id_ed25519_wnc.pub ~/.ssh/`
  - change permissions on ssh private and public key files in wsl.
    - `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_lipi`
    - `chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_lipi.pub`
    - `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_wnc`
    - `chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_wnc.pub `
    - Verify Permissions: `ls -ahl ~/.ssh/`  
  - created a `load-keys.sh` file in `~/.ssh/` folder.
  - Updated bashrc to source this file whenever a new wsl terminal is opened.
  - updated bash_profile file to source bashrc each time a new wsl is opened. 
  - git push worked.

Problems:

1. After restructuring evrything with environment and modules, I started receiving this error with terraform plan 
```
╷
│ Error: Unreadable module directory
│
│ Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat ../../modules: no such file or
│ directory
╵

╷
│ Error: Unreadable module directory
│
│ The directory  could not be read for module "wnc_mess_app_service" at
│ modules.tf:2.
╵

Operation failed: failed running terraform init (exit 1)
```
Resolution: As we are using Terraform cloud,by default it is set for “Remote” execution mode. It tries to run your Terraform code on its own servers, and those can't see your local file paths like ../../modules/app-service. Changing the Execution Mode to Local in `Terraform Cloud -> Settings (Workspace level) -> Execution Mode -> Select Local -> Save` resolved this issue.

By switching the execution mode to Local, you're telling Terraform to run everything on your own WSL environment, which has access to the relative local module paths — exactly what you need for local module development.
