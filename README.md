1. Github for windows via powershell
  - install ssh for windows via powershell
  - setup ssh keys (one for lipi's github account, one for shantanu's wnc account)
  - add public keys to respective github accounts.
  - setup local github config credentials in repective github repo folder created (D://Lipi/wnc-mess-terraform was configured)
    - git config user.name "Lipi Lapsiwala"
    - git config user.email "lipi.lapsiwala@gmail.com"
    - if this needs to be configured globally, --global flat would be used in the command above. 
    - But that will work only with one github account
  - connected local folder wnc-mess-terraform to remote repo wnc-mess-terraform
2. Latest VSCode version was installed from microsoft store.
3. Install wsl via microsoft store
4. Install Install the WSL 2 kernel update manually
  - Go to this official link: ðŸ‘‰ https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel
  - It will redirect you to the Microsoft download page.
  - Download the .msi file named WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines.
  - Run the installer â€” it takes just 30 seconds.
5. Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS was installed from microsoft store
6. Ubuntu 24.04.1 was set as a default terminal in VS Code.
7. tfenv was installed in ubuntu.
  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install unzip
  - git clone https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv.git ~/.tfenv
  - echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.tfenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  - source ~/.bashrc
  - tfenv --version
  - tfenv install 1.6.6 (1.6.6 is the last stable version with all features. 1.7 to 10 are used by hashicorp. 1.11.3 is too latest and might not support all features)
  - tfenv use 1.6.6
  - terraform --version
8. Install Azure CLI in ubuntu
  - curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
  - az version
  - login to az: `az login --use-device-code`
    - open `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin` in browser
    - enter code shown as an output of `az login` command.
    - select an azure account to login to.
    - go back to ubuntu terminal
    - select appropriate subscription.
9. Created a free account on Terraform cloud for backend. 
  - created an organization: wnc-mess-terraform-backend
  - created a project: wnc-mess (Not useful in terraform configuration. This is for user's understanding)
  - Created a workspace: wnc-mess-terraform-backend
  - Used this URL as a reference to add environment variables in Terraform cloud workspace: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/azure-remote
  - Was giving some path error after using cloud as a backend for azure. Replaced cloud with a proper terraform {backend {} }. block.
  - updated terraform version to ~> 1.6.0 under workspace settings -> General -> Terraform version. It was 1.11.3 before. 
10. Copy over ssh keys created in step 1 from windows to linux. 
  - change permissions on ssh public and private key files in windows via powershell.
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi /inheritance:r`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi /grant:r "shant:F"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi /remove "Users" "Authenticated Users" "Everyone"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi.pub /inheritance:r`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi.pub /grant:r "shant:F"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi.pub /remove "Users" "Authenticated Users" "Everyone"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc /inheritance:r`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc /grant:r "shant:F"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc /remove "Users" "Authenticated Users" "Everyone"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc.pub /inheritance:r`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc.pub /grant:r "shant:F"`
    - `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_wnc.pub /remove "Users" "Authenticated Users" "Everyone"`
    - check grants syntax: 
      - `icacls <public or private key file path>`
      - example: `icacls C:\Users\shant\.ssh\id_ed25519_lipi`
  - copy those files over to wsl
    - `cp /mnt/c/Users/shant/.ssh/id_ed25519_lipi ~/.ssh/`
    - `cp /mnt/c/Users/shant/.ssh/id_ed25519_lipi.pub ~/.ssh/`
    - `cp /mnt/c/Users/shant/.ssh/id_ed25519_wnc ~/.ssh/`
    - `cp /mnt/c/Users/shant/.ssh/id_ed25519_wnc.pub ~/.ssh/`
  - change permissions on ssh private and public key files in wsl.
    - `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_lipi`
    - `chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_lipi.pub`
    - `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_wnc`
    - `chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_wnc.pub `
    - Verify Permissions: `ls -ahl ~/.ssh/`  
  - created a `load-keys.sh` file in `~/.ssh/` folder.
  - Updated bashrc to source this file whenever a new wsl terminal is opened.
  - updated bash_profile file to source bashrc each time a new wsl is opened. 
  - git push worked
